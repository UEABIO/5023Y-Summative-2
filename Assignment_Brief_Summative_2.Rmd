# 1. Outline


You are being given the choice of three possible datasets. 

With your chosen dataset you are tasked with using exploratory data analysis and background reading to develop hypotheses that you will test with robust linear models. You will then write-up and communicate your findings with a clear results section and good data visuals in the style of a paper/lab report.

You only need to analyse one data set, and you do not need to test *everything* within a dataset in order to make an excellent report. Planning and demonstration of thorough analysis of carefully chosen hypotheses with excellent write-ups and clear data visuals, is preferable to trying to study everything!


## Hand-in

### Repository

Your project on Posit Cloud - it MUST be the Assignment Project in the shared workspace

1) Well presented R script(s) for data cleaning, exploratory analysis & model building
2) A Quarto document with outputs only that forms the report
3) The knitted pdf of your report


### Report

Publish a report (file 3) as a pdf and hand-in through the assignment portal on Blackboard. 


# 2. Information on the datasets


Choose one data set to work on for your report.

    
## 2.1 The datasets in brief:

    
  - Studying the cost of singing in the decorated cricket, *Gryllodes sigillatus* 
  
  - The deleterious effects of inbreeding on flight performance in the butterfly *Bicyclus anynana*
  
  - The effect of an anti-cancer drug on p21 gene expression during the cell cycle


## 2.2 Some ideas for analysis


Below I provide some hints  and ideas about how to make interesting reports for each of the datasets. Remember - you only need to analyse **ONE** dataset, and you don't need to analyse everything. 


### Cricket song

`cricket_song.csv`

A study of the relationship between, among other things, condition, resource availability (food quality) and sexual signalling (calling song) in the decorated cricket, *Gryllodes sigillatus*. Male crickets "sing" to attract females by rubbing specialised areas of their wings together, an activity which is energetically costly.


The important variables from our point of view is `Delta_smi` which is the change in weight over a week of study

| Variable            | Definition                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|Delta_smi      | Change in weight (g) |                      
| Diet      | Percentage nutritional content of the food the animal was fed    |
| Song_week1    | The total amount of time the cricket spent singing in the first week of the experiment   |
| Mass0    | Mass (g) at start of experiment  |
| Pronotum    | Size (mm) The pronotum is a prominent plate that covers the thorax and can be used as a proxy for body size |


### Inbreeding in butterflies

`inbreeding_butterfly.csv`

A study of the relationship between inbreeding and flight ability. 


| Variable            | Definition                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|ID      | Individual |                      
|IC      | Inbreeding coefficient - three levels indicating the number of generations of sib-matings in recent family history    |
|FII     | FII is the flight inhibition index – the number of times the butterfly settled during a two-minute period when it was being stimulated to take off immediately once it settled   |
|body_part    | Thorax or rest of body  |
|dry_weight    | The dry weight in (mg) of the part of the butterfly |

### p21 expression

`Gene_Expression.csv`

Changes in the expression of p21 can serve as a biomarker for potential treatment efficacy as a sign of induced therapeutic benefits in cancer treatment if it is inducing senescence or apoptosis:


| Variable            | Definition                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|Cell Cycle Progression     | the progression through the cell cycle, ranging from 0.0 (beginning of the cycle) to 1.0 (completion of the cycle). It serves as a timeline for cellular activities. |                      
|Treatment     | Control: Cells are left untreated, serving as a baseline for normal gene expression patterns during the cell cycle.
Treated: Cells are exposed to a specific treatment, potentially affecting gene expression. |   
|Gene Expression Level    | This quantitative measure indicates the level of expression of a particular gene of interest. Changes in this value may reflect cellular responses to the treatment or inherent variations during the cell cycle.. |  


# 3. General guide to the report

- Word limit and document formatting:

    - The report should be submitted as one pdf document.

    - The maximum length is 750 words.
    
    - The 750 word limit includes: title, main text (stated hypotheses, results & discussion)

    - It does not include: plot legends, tables or the references.

## 3.1 Your report MUST have these sections

1. Title


2. Main text

    - Hypotheses
    
    - Analysis
    
    - Results
    
    - Discussion
    

3. References


## 3.2 Sections in detail

### Title
The title should describe your main question and/or your main result and what species you are using. We encourage interesting and enticing titles.
  

### Analysis

1) Overview
Describe the problem. What substantive question are you trying to address? This needn’t be long, but it should be clear.

2) Data and model
What data did you use to address the question, and how did you do it? Did you have to apply any transformations, exclude any outliers?


When describing your approach, be specific. For example:

- Don’t say, “I ran an ANOVA” when you instead can say, “I used an ordinary least squares linear model to analyse plant biomass  in a factorial design with light and fertilizer treatments as categorical predictors”

- Justify important features of your modeling approach "The best fitting model to explain plant biomass included an interaction term". 


- State the R version used, and *briefly* R packages and why they were used. 

![Describe your analysis clearly](img/analysis.png)

### Results and discussion

The ‘letter’ style manuscripts differ from article style, in that the main text contains
both results and discussion, blended together. To achieve this, each paragraph or
section should contain:

• a short descriptive header

• a question, query or hypothesis

• a test or analysis you performed

• the result (described verbally *and* in plots/tables)

  - **DO** include - Raw data figures, visual model summaries, model tables
  
  - **DON'T** include - Model checking plots, exploratory analysis

• a brief discussion/comment (1-2 sentences) discussing the biological
implications of the result, similar observations, mentioning any caveats, and/or
new questions, etc.


### Example

**Differential Gene Expression** <span style="color: red;">[Each paragraph has a heading]</span>


<span style="color: red;">[Hypothesis goes here]</span> I hypothesised that essential genes would be more highly expressed
than non-essential genes, because they are involved in central cellular processes for which more abundant proteins would be required. <span style="color: red;">[test]</span> To test this hypothesis, I compared
the protein expression levels of essential and non-essential genes using a general linear model with essential/non-essential gene as a factorial predictor variable against rank ordered protein expression levels.<span style="color: red;">[test]</span>  This analysis showed that essential genes have on average 1.3 fold (95% CI: 0.8-1.6) higher protein expression levels than non-essential genes (*F*~1,34~= 637, *P* <0.001, *R^2* = 0.94, Figure 1).
<span style="color: red;">[discussion/comment]</span> * Similar results have been observed in other species such as **x** 
<span style="color: red;">[citations]</span> , showing that this is a general trend of molecular biology. It is possible that
the majority of this result is due to ribosomal proteins. <span style="color: red;">[next paragraph might be a test of this conclusion]</span> .

<span style="color: red;">Don’t put these red markers in your own text!!!</span>

I have included papers from the journal BMC Biology in the GitHub Assignment - take a look at these for examples of how to structure this write-up style. 


![Really great write-ups focus on the biology, and convey the direction, magnitude and uncertainty of a finding](img/reporting.png)

#### Figures and Figure legends

Your intended audience for these figures are other scientists, your figure may be complex, but must be clear and accurate - and it must be supported by a great figure legend. 

A great figure legend has several parts

1. A title. Make the first line of the legend a sentence that *summarises the major result*

2. The method. Clearly explain the details of the experiment, and provide the details of your analysis

3. Definitions and descriptions. Make sure all symbols, lines, colours, abbreviations, error bars and any other components are defined and described properly

Your figure leged can easily be 100-200 words. It should be succinct but comprehensive, use complete sentences and aim for a quality of figure and legend that means it could be understood outside of the context of the rest of the report

![Figure 1: *Drosophila melanogaster* lifespan increases with body size across three treatments of differing male sexual activity. Fitted model slopes are from the reduced linear model (main effects only of thorax size, sleep and treatment group; adjusted R^2 = 0.59) indicating that every 0.1mm increase in thorax increases longevity by 14.4 days(95% CI 11.8-17.0), lines are regression slopes with 95% confidence intervals, circles are individual data points, colours indicate treatments. Marginal plots are density plot distributions for thorax length (top) and longevity (right) split by treatments.](img/fly.png)

*Do not get fixated on producing the perfect statistical model, note this is only worth 5 marks overall. Check the brief to make sure you address all parts required.* 

# 6. Guidance

## 6.1 How to start

* Go through the README files and look at the spreadsheets, make sure you know what is in the dataset

* Come up with some initial ideas you wish to test in the data, do some reading, come up with two or three simple hypotheses with sensible biology behind them

* Tidy the data, this takes time

* Visualise differences and relationships before you start modelling

* Have you included all important variables or hypothesised interaction terms?

* Does the model meet the assumptions of a linear model - does it require any transformations?

## 6.2 Deadline

All assignment deadlines are always available on e-vision. 


## 6.3 Help & Support

You should make good use of Blackboard discussion forums - you can submit anonymously and I will respond quickly

    
Any major issues and you can also e-mail me and request a chat! 

## 6.4 Start early!

That way you can think about which dataset you want to work with, do some exploratory analysis, background reading etc. before we have even finished our linear model lectures. 

Giving yourself more time with the workshop materials & the assignment trends with a higher final mark.

# 7. Appropriate use of AI

Below I have outlined appropriate and inappropriate uses for generative AI tools. Used responsibly these can improve and speed up your work and productivity. But they must be used cautiously, generating code that you do not understand is irresponsible and can lead to incorrect or biased results. 

Generative AI is a fantastic tool, but it is also limited in ways you may not fully appreciate. Most models have been trained on datasets that do not separate peer-reviewed scientific literature from poor quality writing as such they have little quality control. They also learn inefficiently - and therefore lack nuance in understanding and may miss the point. For coding they can reproduce simple code effectively, but can introduce bias when used to make decisions without oversight. They are trained on older data and can therefore introduce bugs or produce code that clearly does not match that taught on this course.

We reserve the right to ask anyone to come to a discussion meeting on their assignment before marks are finalised. Please ask if you would like to clarify any appropriate use cases. 

All uses of generative AI must be declared.

|Writing     | Create writing from scratch (ChatGPT, Bard) |   No |      Writing developed from scratch would be plagiarism (not your words) and reduces opportunities for critical thinking |                 
|    | Reviewing, summarising or synthesising literature |   No | AI is trained on an opaque (unknown) dataset, and is a poor learner - many scientists have reported incorrect summaries of complex ideas and bias | 
|     | Editing |   Yes | Using AI to improve grammar, clarity of sentences and structure is a great assistance feature - overlaps with Grammarly (provided by the university) | 
|Coding   | Create code from scratch |   No | Prevents opportunities to learn essential coding skills, often provides incorrect or inefficient code, trained on old versions of R | 
|  | Build models or exploratory analyses |   No | Will choose routes of investigation without oversight - potentially leading to biased analyses | 
|  | Debug or check code |   Yes | Can find errors quickly and easily | 
|  | Annotate code |   Yes | Can improve readability through suggested annotations|
